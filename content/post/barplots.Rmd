This section of my blog teaches you how to create a barplot using R Studio. We first need to bring in the necessary packages and then use the library command:
```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)
```
Step two is extracting the data. For this example we will be looking at the 1980 baseball teams homerun distribution. We can gather this data from the Lahman tables using an sqldf query.Then, we use ggplot() and tell the program the type of graph (barplot), what data (result), and how we would like the data to be displayed. Note I added x and y lables as well as a title.
```{r}
query<-"SELECT name,HR
FROM Teams
WHERE yearID=1980
ORDER BY HR"
result<-sqldf(query)

result$name<-factor(result$name,levels=result$name)

ggplot()+
  geom_bar(data=result,aes(x=name,y=HR),stat='identity',color="white",fill="blue")+
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("Homeruns")+
  xlab("Teams")+
  ggtitle("1980 Team Homerun Distribution")
```
