In this section of my blog I will be showing you how to create a scatterplot using R Studio. First, we must install the necessary packages and bring them into our library. 
```{r}
library(sqldf)
library(Lahman)
library(ggplot2)
```
extracting data --------------
```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,sum(HR) AS career_HR,sum(SO) AS career_SO
FROM Batting
GROUP BY playerID
HAVING sum(HR)>=400"

result<-sqldf(query)
```
```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=career_SO,y=career_HR),size=3,color="blue")+
  ggtitle("Career Strikeouts vs Homeruns for Great Hitters")+
  xlab("career strikeouts")+
  ylab("career homeruns")
```
